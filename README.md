# Game Overview:

Power Pong is essentially 2-Player Pong but with a special twist.
Each time a player reflects the ball, the ball will speed up and continuously ramp up in speed over the course of the game until it reaches a point where it is almost impossible to catch the ball.
In order to win, a player must reach a score of 3.

The game has three difficulties which each offer a unique experience for a variety of players.
For instance, some may want to stick closer to original Pong, while alternatively there are those who want more of a challenge and something different.

## Normal Mode

Closest to normal Pong.
The ball starts off relatively slow, speeding up with each bounce from a player's paddle.
Normal Mode offers an easier experience where the ball doesn't speed up very much.
Even at max speed, the ball is controllable and somewhat easy to keep track of.

## Hard Mode

The ball starts off faster.
Limits on the ball's speed are reduced; the ball ramps up to much higher speeds in Hard Mode.
The ball becomes much harder to track and catch over time, requiring greater reaction time and tracking.
Max speed gets quite ludicrous to the point where eventually a player will just lose the ball.
In Hard Mode and Nightmare Mode, an extra layer of difficulty is added to the game.
Once the ball bounces at least 12 times, each bounce has an additional 50/50 chance to speed up the ball by 7.5%.
This makes the ball harder to predict, and prevents players from winning by just standing still.

## Nightmare Mode

Limits on speed increments are essentially nonexistent.
While the ball takes a longer time to speed up, it will now continue to speed up an infinite amount of times, until it gets completely impossible to catch.
Exclusive to Nightmare Mode, there are now two balls; a purple bonus ball is added to the game.
The bonus ball is very slow, but will still gradually speed up over time.
While its main purpose is to overwhelm players and give them more things to worry about; bonus ball will often bump into the normal pong ball, causing sudden unpredictable collisions, and a rapid switch in speed and directions for both balls, which the players will have to actively anticipate and react to in time.

Nightmare mode is meant to be more wacky and fun than serious; the goal is more so just to have fun.
